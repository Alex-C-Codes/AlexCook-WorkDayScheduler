This Code Quiz is designed to test users based on their knowledge of css, html, and javascript. The quiz asks users a handful of questions and gives feedback on the answers to the questions.

Once the user starts the quiz, a timer appears and begins counting down. When a user answers a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock. Once all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over and the user can save their initials as well as their score.
