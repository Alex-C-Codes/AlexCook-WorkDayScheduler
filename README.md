# AlexCook-WorkDayScheduler
## Work Day Scheduler by Alex Cook

This app helps people save and keep track of events to their work day. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. People can save their events via the time blocks on the app. Once the save button is selected, the event is saved in local storage and will remain even after the page is refreshed. Moreover, when people view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
